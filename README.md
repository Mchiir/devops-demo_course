# Academic DevOps Project

This project demonstrates the use of **DevOps practices** with a sample **Spring Boot** application.

---

## üìå Project Overview

The application is built with **Spring Boot (v3.5.6)** and showcases how modern DevOps workflows (CI/CD, containerization, testing, and monitoring) can be applied to a Java-based backend service.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technologies Used

### 1. **Spring Boot (v3.5.6)**

- Provides the core framework for building the REST API.
- Auto-configures components and manages dependencies.

### 2. **Spring Boot Starters**

- **spring-boot-starter-web** ‚Üí for building RESTful web services.
- **spring-boot-starter-test** ‚Üí includes **JUnit 5**, **Mockito**, **MockMvc**, **Hamcrest**, and **AssertJ** for unit and integration testing.

### 3. **Mockito**

- Mocking framework used for **unit tests**.
- Included via `spring-boot-starter-test`.

### 4. **JUnit 5**

- Primary testing framework for writing structured test cases.

### 5. **Hamcrest & AssertJ**

- Provides readable, expressive assertions in test cases.

### 6. **Docker**

- Application is containerized for easy deployment and portability.

### 7. **CI/CD (GitHub Actions / Jenkins)**

- Automates build, test, and deployment pipelines.

### 8. **Monitoring & Logging**

- Integrated logging and monitoring for observability during runtime.

## üöÄ How Technologies Relate

- **Spring Boot Web** handles API requests and responses.
- **Spring Boot Test** provides the testing ecosystem (JUnit, Mockito, Hamcrest).
- **Mockito** mocks dependencies for isolated **unit testing**.
- **Hamcrest & AssertJ** ensure readable and maintainable assertions.
- **Docker** packages the app into a lightweight container.
- **CI/CD tools** automate integration and deployment of the application.
